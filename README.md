# Post-COVID-19 Emotional Evaluation

A web app for visualizing and evaluating anxiety and depression in post-COVID-19 patients. The app is divided into two sites: one based on a series of HADS and DTS questionnaires that the patient answers regularly, every three months, and collects all the data. The second site is accessed by the professional and allows her/him to retrieve all the data and monitor every patient's progression in time. 

## Game Plan

A friend, who is a clinical psychologist in a Hospital in Barcelona, contacted me to try to improve the process of regularly sending psychological tests to their patients, collecting the data, and visualizing it in a fast and easy way. So far, the whole process was based on phone calls reminders, forwarding results through different doctors, manually rewriting the results on an Excel sheet, adding color on cells, and repeating it over and over with every patient and every questionnaire.

My idea was to create a web app that would get rid of inefficient and redundant steps, and automize the whole process. In addition, improving the user experience both on the patient and professional sides.


## Features 

- A simple and clean data visualization (to allow a fast prognosis).
- A gentle and clear design for the questionnaire (It is a long survey).
- An efficient authorization/authentication control for patients and professionals.
- A scalable backend architecture with a fast and safe DB (we are talking about quite sensitive data).
- Fully responsive.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: ReactJS, Typescript, Chakra UI, Nivo.

Backend: Supabase with PostgreSQL.

## Demo

There is a demo for testing purposes. Feel free to log in (only with Google, sorry).
